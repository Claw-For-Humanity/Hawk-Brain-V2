[31mCMake Error at /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/sdformat12/sdformat12-config.cmake:94 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findignition-utils1.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ignition-utils1", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ignition-utils1"
  with any of the following names:

    ignition-utils1Config.cmake
    ignition-utils1-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ignition-utils1" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "ignition-utils1_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "ignition-utils1" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
